# Brain Activation Studies in Chinese Writing

This repository contains research materials and publications related to the study of brain activation during Chinese and other forms of writing, led by **Yajing Lan**.

## 🧠 Research Focus

Using **functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)**, the research explores:

- The **neural activation patterns** associated with Chinese character writing
- A **comparative analysis** between Chinese writing and other forms of writing (e.g. alphabetic scripts)
- Insights into **language-specific motor and perceptual processes** in children and adults
